# HALT_Flutter_app
HALT(Bus tracking application using flutter ,figma,firebase)
          Figma - I designed an app
          Application was crafted with Flutter.
          Backend : Firebase
          1 Week for development.

 It's just a front-end, and the backend doesn't connect in the application. It requires more original data to work, so it is still in the process. Once it is connected, it will be completed. 


These are my application modules.

"HALT" is the first chosen name.
